# AutosarE2E

E2E stands for end-to-end communication protection.

The concept of E2E communication protection assumes that safety-related data exchange must be protected at runtime against faults on the communication link. E2E communication protection detects faults occurring between a sender and a receiver, including systematic software faults (introduced in the lower communication layers of the sender or receiver) and random hardware faults (caused by MCU hardware, communication peripherals, transceivers, communication lines, or other communication infrastructure).
